- 👋 Hi, I’m @caycat95
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis using Python, Python unittests, and full-stack web development using Django. In terms of the full-stack web development, I have professional experience in designing and implementing an internal, private metrics web app. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to freelance after experiencing repeated medical problems. I am also learning web-scraping at this time! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python unittests!
- 📫 How to reach me - don't hesitate to ping me!
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have had successful internships at the Open Source Lab and Intel. At the time, these workplaces either hired me afterward or extended my internship contract.
